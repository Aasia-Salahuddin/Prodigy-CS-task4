**KEY LOGGER**
By leveraging Pythonâ€™s capabilities, I developed a basic keylogger that captured and logged keystrokes.
It records and logs keystrokes.

Ensure that you have the keyboard library installed in your Python environment. 
Open your command prompt or terminal and execute the following command:
